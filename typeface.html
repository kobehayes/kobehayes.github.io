                    <p>The origins of blackletter script can be traced to the Gutenberg Bible. I was given access to
                        Washington
                        University&#39;s leaf of
                        the
                        Gutenberg
                        Bible
                        from their Special Collections.</p>
                    <p>In my research, I learned that people grew tired of the Gutenberg Bible&#39;s poor legibility,
                        which
                        would
                        later
                        inspire the
                        first serif typeface. As you can see, this text has a lovely uniformity and rhythm, but it&#39;s
                        quite
                        difficult to
                        read.</p>

                    <p>There are many blackletter typefaces out there, but I focused on ATF&#39;s blackletter typefaces.
                        There
                        are
                        three
                        that I am
                        aware of: Engravers Old English, Cloister Black, and American Text. Each of these takes a
                        slightly
                        different
                        approach,
                        and they provide a nice variety of choice.</p>
                    <p>Although I took inspiration from all three, I decided to focus of reviving Engravers Old English.
                        It
                        felt
                        almost like
                        a
                        middle ground between Cloister and American, and I liked the more square and rigid shapes
                        combined
                        with
                        more
                        traditional
                        ornamentation.</p>
                </div>

            </span>
            <span>
                <div class="typeface-body">
                    <p>Because Engravers was not a digital typeface, I only had the original specimen to start with. I
                        began
                        my
                        process by
                        tracing vectors of the scanned specimen. This was important to my process because I needed a
                        higher
                        quality
                        rendering to
                        use as a template for my revival.</p>

                <div class="typeface-body">
                    <p>I did a lot of experimentation with the parallel pen, trying to mimick Engravers as well as other
                        blackletters for
                        inspiration.</p>
                    <p>There were certain individual letters that I consistently had problems with. Some of the caps
                        seemed
                        to
                        veer
                        away
                        from
                        the geometry of the others. An example of this is B, K, and R. They are styled similarly to each
                        other,
                        but
                        different
                        from the other caps.</p>
                    <p>I hit a roadblock when I realized that some of the caps did not follow the traditional stroke of
                        the
                        parallel
                        pen.
                        This
                        on its own is okay, but there was a clear visual difference that needed to be corrected. This
                        issue
                        was
                        found in D,
                        F,
                        I, and J. I used the pen to sketch several iterations of these letters to get them closer to the
                        rest of
                        the
                        set.
